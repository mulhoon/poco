# poco ♫
Reverse chord lookup at lightning speed in Javascript (1kb)

## How?
**poco** uses [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) to generate an indexed table of all chords, including inversions. This table is used to look up chords and therefore doesn’t run *any* calculations. This makes *poco* over **400x faster** (800x on iOS) at chord recognition than [piu](https://github.com/saebekassebil/piu). It does however take around 50ms to initialize, but it's worth it.

## Why?
I'm a huge fan of [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria). *poco* was created before I discovered [piu](https://github.com/saebekassebil/piu). Both use different methods to lookup chords. *poco* happens to be faster and smaller, so I thought I'd share it.

## Installation
``` 
	npm install pocojs
```

## Usage

Initialise poco
``` javascript
	poco.init();
```

Find a chord
``` javascript
	poco.find(['a','c','e','g']);

	/* returns...
	{
		name: 'Amin7', 
		othernames:['C6/A'], 
		inversion:0, 
		t: [teoria chord object]
	}
	*/
```
